# Bluetooth Serial Pro
This is the pro version of [HM10 Bluetooth Serial](https://github.com/hoiberg/HM10-BluetoothSerial-iOS). As I have quit iOS development and there was still some demand for this app, I decided to upload the code to GitHub. It is written in Swift 5.0 or 5.1 I believe but I don't know whether it will still compile or run. 

There are some changes compared to the last app store version as I was working on an update (most significantly, I added the possibility to configure alert sounds for received data) and I believe this update was pretty much done - but again, I'm not sure. The commit history has been removed for privacy reasons.

Update: It is again on the App Store, made available by someone else: Link: https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/bleserial-hm-10/id1602239700 He also re-uploaded the lite version: https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/ble-serial-tiny/id1607862132
